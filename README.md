The code to run the experiment is found in the Experiment folders. It can be run using Python (2.7.x) along with the library Kelpy (found on Steve Piantadosi's Github page).

The data can be found in the data folder. There are both the eye-tracker data and the behavioral data from both the estimation and discrimination tasks.

Much of the code for data analysis is in the assorted_analyses2.Rmd file. The code used to run the hierarchical Bayesian models for both the estimation and discrimination tasks is found in the .ipynb files.
